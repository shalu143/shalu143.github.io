## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### DATA SCIENTIST | Jio Platforms Limited |Navi Mumabai- Maharashtra| Apr 2020- Present
#### Roles and Responsibilties
*Collaborate with business team, gather requirements and understand them
* Build a data driven scalable solution to solve complex business problems
* Design, Develop, Validate and Deploy machine learning models. Also, maintain, monitor those models and provide support to the end users
* Mentoring Interns and Capability building of different teams by organizing knowledge sharing sessions, trainings and workshops
#### Projects
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Automation tool: Built a python package for EDA automation named “dataanalyser” and an API to be used by reliance senior management and technical teams resulting in time saving (~ 70 %) and increased productivity
* RSRP (Signal Power) Prediction and Etilt- Optimization of the Jio Towers: Implemented a Neural Network model with variables derived from domain path loss models to predict the Received Signal Power of a user equipment. Scaled the model for one Jio Centre. PAN India implementation is WIP.
As a result, third party license cost to be eliminated
* Audit Process Automation: Developed templates for Audit controls to automate the process from ingestion of data and producing audit report. Manual efforts were eliminated and resulted in increased productivity
* LPG Cylinder Distribution cost Optimization and developing a front-end solution: Automated the Route creation using hybrid approach that used clustering followed by Knapsack and TSP that results in least cost while delivering cylinders from Bottling plants to Distribution Outlets.
As a result, Manual efforts were eliminated and cost reduction of ~ 10% per distributor annually. Project is in final validation stage
